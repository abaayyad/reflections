How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
easier to know what mistakes or unwanted changes i have done.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It is probable that i would need to restore some versions of parts of a prevous version, this enables me to do it faster and more efficient

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
you probably know better when you have to create a commit rather than being automatically which would create too much or less than the needed number of commits, also your commits would be more accurate in comparision to automatic commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Since git is code oriented and most big coding projects require multiple files, saving multiple files is more practical

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can be more confident that any mistake that i do i will be more able to track it and fix it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try and implement it in all my work visual studio codes to learn the most effective and efficient way in developing and sharing projects.
