When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
to share projects or if i work on more than one place/computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes, another user might have updated the github folder but I don't want these changes for my local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks -> make a copy of an online reposotory into your github account
clone -> make a copy of an online/offline reposotory into your local machines
branch -> create a new branch on th reposotory which you are using whether it's online or offline
